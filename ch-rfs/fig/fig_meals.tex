  \textbf{\acrlong{rfs} models outperform competitors in meal
 recommendation in terms of sampled recall computed using \Cref{eq:sampled-recall}. Comparison models are described in \Cref{sec:models} (see \Cref{sec:appendix-empirical} for hyperparameters). The \gls{rfs} regression functions $f$ are defined in \Cref{eqn:rankfromsets,eqn:neural-network,eqn:residual} for the inner product, neural network, and residual models, respectively.}%
