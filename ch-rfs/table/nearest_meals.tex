\caption[Qualitative evaluation of \textsc{rfs} for food recommendation]{\textbf{\acrlong{rfs} trained on food consumption data provides diverse meal recommendations.} \gls{rfs} with \Cref{eqn:residual} is fit to data from a diet tracking app; items are meals and attributes are the ingredients in the meal. Meals are represented the average of their attribute embeddings, and cosine similarity between meal representations is used to find the nearest neighbors of meals (user-level information cannot be shown as this is personal diet data). \gls{rfs} reveals eating patterns: for example, the second-last query meal is a mix of meat, vegetables, and fruit, and the nearest neighbor meal is a different meat with a side of salad; the last query meal is a sandwich, and its nearest neighbor is also a sandwich with different ingredients.}% This reveals
% that \acrlong{rfs} uncovers latent patterns of consumption in the attribute
% embeddings that can be leveraged to improve recommendations.
