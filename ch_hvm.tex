\chapter{Hierarchical Variational Models for Statistical Physics}
\label{ch:hvm}
\lettrine[image=true,lines=3]{design/A}{s} probabilistic modeling finds widespread use in science, it is necessary to adapt machine learning tools to the specifics of a scientific domain. In this chapter we focus on probabilistic models used in statistical physics. Whether such models are used in molecular dynamics simulations for finding drug candidates for disease~\citep{shamay2018quantitative} or simulating solid state systems for materials design~\citep{schmidt2019recent}, the scalability of machine learning methods is a bottleneck for progress. Simulations need to be run for longer timescales and in larger systems, and must leverage knowledge about the physical system under study to yield accurate predictions. As a step in this direction, this chapter centers on building scalable variational approximations for statistical physics models, and develops hierarchical probabilistic models to study their performance in large statistical physics systems.
