## Dropped capitals with colored backgrounds

The Illustrator file for colorizing the backgrounds of drop caps is in `/design/typography.ai`. To colorize backgrounds, import a page of the PDF with the drop cap, use [this](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/60548/how-can-i-open-a-pdf-in-illustrator-and-convert-text-with-a-missing-font-into-ou) to convert it to shapes, make a new layer on top of the letter, then use the Pathfinder tool to excise the shape (instead of using the compound path). Select everything but the letter, and change the color.
