  \caption[Variational inference cartoon]{
  \textbf{Variational inference finds the member of the variational family closest to the target distribution.} The oval in the cartoon represents the space of variational approximations $q(\mbz; \mblambda)$, and the goal of \acrlong{vi} is to find variational parameters $\mblambda^*$ that yield an approximation close to the target probability model $p(\mbz)$. One way to measure the distance between a variational approximation and the target probability distribution is with the \gls{kl} divergence.}
