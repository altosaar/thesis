  \caption[Graphical model for logistic regression]{
  \textbf{Binary classification is a probabilistic modeling technique used in recommender systems.} Observed random variables are denoted by shaded nodes, and directed edges in the graph indicated conditional dependence on a node's parents. There are $N$ independent, identically distributed observations $(y_n, x_n)$; the rectangular plate denotes repetition of nodes and edges. The model predicts a binary response $y_n$ using parameters $\mbtheta$ and covariates $x_n$.}
