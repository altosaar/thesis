\section{Discussion}

\paragraph{Counterfactual variational inference.} Applying variational inference to study physics models can lead to new algorithms. \citet{nicoli2019comment} develop an importance sampling algorithm that can generalize a variational family fit to a model with fixed temperature parameter to other temperatures.

The Gibbs-Bologiubov-Feynman inequality holds for quantum systems~ \citep{feynman1972statistical}; applying the machine learning tools developed for variational inference to quantum systems is a direction for future work.

Physics tools have been useful in machine learning~\citep{bamler2017perturbative}. Tools from machine learning such as the \gls{vi} framework and \glspl{hvm} can also be applied to statistical physics.
