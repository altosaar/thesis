\chapter{Proximity Variational Inference}
\label{ch:pvi}
\lettrine[image=true,lines=3]{design/P}{reviously}, \Cref{ch:hvm,ch:rfs} highlighted how consideration of the problem structure enabled efficient probabilistic modeling solutions to applied questions in physics and recommender systems. Can problem structure be of use at a higher level, in an inference algorithm that can be re-used across probability models? We develop \acrlong{PVI} in this chapter, which enables \acrlong{vi} to leverage information about variational approximations during optimization to improve the accuracy of inference.
